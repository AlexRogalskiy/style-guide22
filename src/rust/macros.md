# Macros

Be mindful that macro definitions are often much easier to write than to read.


TODO
    if it is DRY without, don't use a macro
    prefer functions, etc. to macros
    custom derives - keep it simple, avoid non-obvious usage
    use serde, other standard libs rather than writing own code
